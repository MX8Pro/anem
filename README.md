Modern Tkinter application styled with [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `ttkbootstrap` (optional but recommended for modern theme)

pip install ttkbootstrap
```

## Running

The interface supports light and dark themes and uses Bootstrap-inspired styling for a more professional look.
The latest redesign introduces a sidebar-driven layout, animated status updates, and a collapsible results panel for a more dynamic experience.
